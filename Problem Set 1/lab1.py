# Problem 1.2: Multiple choice

# Which part of a rule may change the data?
#    1. the antecedent
#    2. the consequent
#    3. both

ANSWER_1 = '2'

# A rule-based system about Monty Python's "Dead Parrot" sketch
# uses the following rules:
#
# rule1 = IF( AND( '(?x) is a Norwegian Blue parrot',
#                  '(?x) is motionless' ),
#             THEN( '(?x) is not dead' ) )
#
# rule2 = IF( NOT( '(?x) is dead' ),
#             THEN( '(?x) is pining for the fjords' ) )
#
# and the following initial data:
#
# ( 'Polly is a Norwegian Blue parrot',
#   'Polly is motionless' )
#

# Will this system produce the datum 'Polly is pining for the
# fjords'?  Answer 'yes' or 'no'.
ANSWER_2 = 'no'

# Which rule contains a programming error? Answer '1' or '2'.
ANSWER_3 = '2'
# The answer is 2 because, as it says in the lab description, "A
# NOT clause should not introduce new variables - the matcher
# won't know what to do with them."  In forward chaining, let's
# suppose there were no assertions of the form '(?x) is dead',
# then we would try to instantiate the consequent, but what would
# we fill the variable with?  So we cannot forward chain.  Let's
# suppose instead that we found 'Polly is dead' so we did not
# instantiate the consequent.  But then in backward chaining, we
# might need 'Martha is pining for the fjords', and nothing says
# that 'Martha is dead' so it would work -- and different forward
# and backward chaining results would be a disaster.  So NOT
# statements in the antecedent must not have any variables.




# In a completely different scenario, suppose we have the
# following rules list:
#
# ( IF( AND( '(?x) has feathers',  # rule 1
#            '(?x) has a beak' ),
#       THEN( '(?x) is a bird' ),
#   IF( AND( '(?y) is a bird',     # rule 2
#            '(?y) cannot fly',
#            '(?y) can swim' ),
#       THEN( '(?y) is a penguin' ) ) )
#
# and the following list of initial data:
#
# ( 'Pendergast is a penguin',
#   'Pendergast has feathers',
#   'Pendergast has a beak',
#   'Pendergast cannot fly',
#   'Pendergast can swim' )
#
# In the following questions, answer '0' if neither rule does
# what is asked.  After we start the system running, which rule
# fires first?

ANSWER_4 = '1'
# Rule 1's preconditions, that some one thing both have feathers
# and a beak, are met by the data when that thing is Pendergast.
# The consequent changes the data, so the rule fires.

# Which rule fires second?

ANSWER_5 = '0'
# The preconditions for Rule 2 are met, but the consequent is
# already present, so it doesn't fire.  Same for Rule 1.  So no
# rule fires.

# Problem 1.3.1: Poker hands

# You're given this data about poker hands:
poker_data = ( 'two-pair beats pair',
               'three-of-a-kind beats two-pair',
               'straight beats three-of-a-kind',
               'flush beats straight',
               'full-house beats flush',
               'straight-flush beats full-house' )


# Fill in this rule so that it finds all other combinations of
# which poker hands beat which, transitively. For example, it
# should be able to deduce that a three-of-a-kind beats a pair,
# because a three-of-a-kind beats two-pair, which beats a pair.
transitive_rule = IF( AND('(?x) beats (?y)', '(?y) beats (?z)'), THEN('(?x) beats (?z)') )

# You can test your rule like this:
# print forward_chain([transitive_rule], poker_data)

# Here's some other data sets for the rule. The tester uses
# these, so don't change them.
TEST_RESULTS_TRANS1 = forward_chain([transitive_rule],

    'scissors beats paper', 
    'paper beats rock' ])


# Problem 1.3.2: Family relations

# First, define all your rules here individually. That is, give
# them names by assigning them to variables. This way, you'll be
# able to refer to the rules by name and easily rearrange them if
# you need to.

# Then, put them together into a list in order, and call it
# family_rules.
